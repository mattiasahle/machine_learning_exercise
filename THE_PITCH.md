# Machine Learning Lab: Activity Recognition with Neural Networks

## Ever wondered how ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot actually work?

You are living through the AI revolution. Now peek behind the curtain and discover the elegance powering this transformation.

Build a real neural network from scratch - the same architecture that evolved into modern Transformers. Your activity classifier will use identical principles to GPT-4's context windows. **The difference? Just scale.** In one afternoon, transform raw sensor data into a working system with 95% accuracy.

Along the way, understand why LLMs hallucinate, how attention mechanisms work, what makes neural networks learn. The "magic" dissolves into clear, intuitive mathematics.

**For curious minds who want to understand the revolution they're living through. No ML background needed.** 🚀
